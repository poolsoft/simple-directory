Simple business directory plugin for WordPress.  Custom post type with single listing and archive templates included.

== Description ==
THIS PLUGIN IS IN BETA!  Things might not work... 
Let me know in the support section.
Simple Directory allows you to easily create a directory of people, places, business... anything really!

Simple Directory creates a custom post type (Listings) with the following fields:
* Address
* Telephone numbers
* Website URL
* Fax number
* Email address
* Social links (G+, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Instagram)


= Custom Templates =
Simple Directory comes with two templates: single-listing.php and archive-listing.php.
Single-listing.php displays a complete version of the listing including:
* Name
* Address
* Contact info (with click-to-call phone number)
* Social profiles
* "Get Directions" link
* Embeded Google Map

The archive-listing.php template displays the listings in a given category showing the address and phone number, with a click to call link on small screens.

= Built to Grow = 
Simple directory is built on Foundation by Zurb and Piklist.

= Recommended Plugins =
Simple Directory requires [Piklist](http://wordpress.org/plugins/piklist) and works best if you also install [Categories Images](http://wordpress.org/plugins/categories-images) and [Allow HTML In Category Descriptions](http://wordpress.org/plugins/allow-html-in-category-descriptions/).
